    "    (x_{1}, y_{1}), (x_{2}, y_{2}),..., (x_{n}, y_{n})\n",

    "  - we assume that each pattern-label pair $(x_{i},y_{i})$ is a *draw* from the same distribution as that of $(X,Y)$. Sometimes the word *realization* is used for instead of \"sample\".\n",
    "  - both *draw* and *realization* are a bit imprecise but convenient; deterministic numbers admit no notion of distribution or independence.\n",
    "  - when we want to do math and statistics of learning, we assume that the sample consists of *n* iid / i.i.d ($=$ independent, identically-distributed) copies of $(X,Y)$:\n",
